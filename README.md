This is a description of the project 

Intermediate Programming with Python Group Project 
This is a group assignment (4-5 students per group) 
The group project requires that you develop a Python application using data obtained from at least 
three web sites. Your sources must include 
(1) using a site's API to retrieve structured data (like JSON or XML), 
(2) web scraping (for data stored in tables), and 
(3) downloading CSV or other data files. 
In addition, your application must use at least one Python library that we have not discussed in either 
Intro or Intermediate. 
The purpose of the application is up to you, but it must have a clear objective – a standalone app as a 
proof-of-concept for a "real" application, a program to support some business goals (which you will have 
to make up), or help a non-profit or government agency, or something that would help other students.  
Of course, the application must be coded in Python and should illustrate topics covered in the course.  
But it should not be limited to what we covered in class – you are encouraged to find and use third-party 
libraries if they help you accomplish your goals. 
Beware of trying to web scrape data from commercial web sites: most companies do *not* want to 
freely give away their data (which they probably stole—uhm, err—acquired from their customers).  
Selenium or Scrapy may help you if you insist on accessing a commercial web site. 
Deliverables (40% of the course grade) 
1. (5 points, out of 100)  I have assigned everyone to a Project Group at random.  You may shift among 
Groups, but: (a) all shifting must be finished by the end of Saturday, Feb. 19; and, (b) no Group may have 
fewer than 4 or more than 5 members.  Someone in your Group must let me know your Group Members 
(including email addresses) and the Cool Group Name you have chosen via email by end of day, Sunday, 
Feb. 20. 
2. (10 points) Draft plan: your basic concept, the overall objective, the basic use cases, and tentative 
sources of data. In addition, include a plan of work: which teammates are responsible for which parts. 
There's no formal template for this, but the doc should be a Word or pdf file. Due on Canvas by end of 
day on Wednesday, Feb. 23. I will review your plan and possibly ask for changes. 
3. Source code (40 points), documentation (10 points), user instructions (5 points), abstract (5 points). 
The documentation does not need to be extensive; at minimum, describe every function and every 
major piece of functionality with a comment. The user instructions will likely be very brief, too. The 
abstract is a one paragraph description; it should be something that you could put in your resume, so it 
should mention what cool Python stuff you used. Due on Canvas by 11:59 pm Thursday, Mar. 3. 
4. (25 points) Presentation video: a 15 minute (maximum) presentation of your project, recorded on 
video and posted on YouTube. Each Group member must do a roughly equal share of the video.  Likely, 
this will be a PowerPoint presentation and a brief demo of your application. Post a Word or pdf file with 
the URL for your video on Canvas by 11:59 pm on Friday, March 4 (the last day of classes).
